# NNDL Final Project: "Neural Approaches for Predicting the Sentiment of Messages in a Twitch.tv Dataset"
This final project showcases my abilities to implement and use Neural Networks and Deep Learning to approach an NLP problem. The final project report can be found in the file called [Seabrum, Kinder - (NNDL Final Project) Neural Approaches for Predicting the Sentiment of Messages in a Twitch.tv Dataset.pdf](https://github.com/xjseabrum/nndl_final_project/blob/main/Seabrum%2C%20Kinder%20-%20(NNDL%20Final%20Project)%20Neural%20Approaches%20for%20Predicting%20the%20Sentiment%20of%20Messages%20in%20a%20Twitch.tv%20Dataset.pdf).  The final project primarily looked at the usage of LSTMs and GRUs with respect to a Twitch.tv dataset. For more information on the methods employed, please briefly read the final report.  

# Class Description and Syllabus
The class (which I took under Donna Gurari at CU Boulder in Spring 2022) went over many topics, including CNNs, RNNs, Computer Vision, Regularization, Attention, Transformers (such as BERT), Transfer Learning, and Speech Processing. The syllabus for the class can be found here: [Class_Syllabus_Schedule.PNG](https://github.com/xjseabrum/nndl_final_project/blob/main/Class_Syllabus_Schedule.PNG)

# Files
As of May 10, 2022, the Google Colab notebook that Scott and I worked on is available in this repository.  Eventually, I plan to update and convert the ipynb file to a Python file.  Additionally, I plan to clean the ipynb file to showcase just the final model that is reported on in the latest version of the report.  

# Future Plans
I plan to explore this dataset a bit further this summer (Summer 2022) using Transformers to see if the accuracy of the model can supersede that current best. 

# Transparency
To the extent to which I can do so, I will be as transparent with my code and writing as possible.  This includes storing major versions of code and previous write-ups/reports into a folder called /old.
