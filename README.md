# NNDL Final Project: "Neural Approaches for Predicting the Sentiment of Messages in a Twitch.tv Dataset"
This final project showcases my abilities to implement and use Neural Networks and Deep Learning to approach an NLP problem. 

The class (which I took in Spring 2022) went over many topics, including CNNs, RNNs, Computer Vision, Regularization, Attention, Transformers (such as BERT), Transfer Learning, and Speech Processing.  The final project primarily looked at the usage of LSTMs and GRUs with respect to a Twitch.tv dataset.  For more information on the methods employed, please briefly read the final report.  

The final project paper can be found in the file called "Seabrum, Kinder - (NNDL Final Project) Neural Approaches for Predicting the Sentiment of Messages in a Twitch.tv Dataset.pdf"

# Files
As of May 10, 2022, the Google Colab notebook that Scott and I worked on is available in this repository.  Eventually, I plan to update and convert the ipynb file to a Python file.  Additionally, I plan to clean the ipynb file to showcase just the final model that we report on.
